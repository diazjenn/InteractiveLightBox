# InteractiveLightBox
Adafruit Feather Huzzah Light and Music Player

## Summary
This Legend of Zelda themed interactive lightbox has 3 modes that feature music and changing lights. In HERO mode, listen to the Song of the Hero as a NeoPixel strip changes between colors to the beat of the song. In ZELDA mode, listen to Zelda's Theme as the NeoPixel gently cycles through a rainbow effect. In NIGHTLIGHT mode, a CDS light sensor monitors the brightness in a room. If it is dark, the lightbox plays the Title Theme and slowly changes color. A secret mode is also programmed!
